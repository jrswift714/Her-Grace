    <h1>Come and See</h1>
    <p id="stories">De'Leon stands rigid among the other soldiers that have been conscripted for siege-fortification on these planes. He is young, no older than 17, his mother kissed him farewell and his father patted him on the back, “Good Lad,” before he marched to the Herald’s legion. His father’s father and that father’s father all blessed themselves to serve in this holy outreach. He shall join them, and stand among those honored heroes of the battlefield where eternal legends stand praiseworthy. </p>

<p id="stories">His squad stands with white and gray banners to shine in the moonlight. The other squads continue to the left and right, seemingly ad infinitum. His Brand walks the line, stern and glorious, plucking the written wills from his squadmates and placing them in his purse. “A battle is ahead, heavy losses are expected. Die valiantly, brethren, may the Convention bless us this long night.” De'Leon thumbs through the gods in his head, carefully selecting which one deserves his petition this time. “May Tempus have mercy and may the Red Knight counsel my leaders,” he prays. Despite the promises of valor, the slightest sense of trepidation crawls along the backs of his heels. He will not waver.</p>

<p id="stories">His heart thunders and the ground trembles to the same rhythm. A drum sounds behind him, as if the percussionist were listening to his heart for their metronome. The Enemy approaches. The storied, rat-like, degenerate demons that dwell away from the beautiful light of the sun march forth on some delirious quest for… vengeance De'Leon presumes. His rally cry harkens a boisterous reply from his squad. As the Ardents pray and the Brands profess, his righteous blade shall excise the hearts of the Enemy without hesitation, and he will stand tall atop a mountain of twisted, pale corpses, striking fear in the hearts of the rest who shall oppress him. “Glory!” He cries, “Glory!”</p>

<p id="stories">Finally, the Enemy shows themselves. They summit the arch of the distant hill, and they hurdle forward. De’Leon sees them now and mourns the realization of the verity of the stories he has heard. Green, Black, Brown and Hideous, the Enemy hobbles toward him with terrific speed. “Charge!” He is commanded, and charge he does. His legs work, his hips ache, his shoulders steel themselves as he pushes with his brothers-in-arms toward these creatures. He lies about 6 men behind the front.</p>

<p id="stories">O, the devastation that is wrought by the goblins of the Quar. They pounce upon the squad, eviscerating them. His compatriot, Lofacques, falls to the earth with a green creature, wielding two shivs of bone, flaying the skin from his scalp. A monstrous brute, covered in brown fur and with jaws of a wolf, pounds atop another of his compatriots, A’voifette, and De'Leon hears the sickening cacophony of shattering bone as his ribcage is stomped by the bugbear. The fearless Brand that leads this charge manages to slay one of the wretched things before he is doused in a black liquid and lit ablaze by another agent of foul treachery. Despite his might in life, the Brand cries for mercy as the flames crawl over his neck. The strength of his calling fades to little more than a whimper as the liquid in the flesh lining his esophagus is evaporated. De'Leon meets the gaze of the melting Brand as the warrior gnaws on the atmosphere around him like a fish pulled from the water. De'Leon thinks that he is trying to say something, but simply can no longer manipulate the muscles of his lips to speak, nor expel the air from his lungs to form a voice. The armor the Brand wears glows orange, and as the Brand struggles, his skin sticks to the metal and strips away from the flesh with ease, exposing muscle and viscera. He falls to the battlefield floor, joining those he egged into this battle. Finally, the Brand stops squirming. All that remains is a charred corpse; the only flesh being that of the rope-like tendons and gristle that can survive immolation. De’Leon wavers. Under what purview could this terrible violence be endorsed? </p>

<p id="stories">The drum continues to sound. It ascends to a perilous tempo.</p>

<p id="stories">De'Leon’s charge meets a weak end as the vigor by which he once madly clamored forward is extinguished by the rabid violence he met at the front. His desire for glory is forgotten. His well wishes from his mother have been forsaken, for now, he finds himself confronting Black Death as simply a child. He thinks of comfort as he turns heel and starts retreating backward. But, alas, the swords of the deviant masses that he once approached are equally as deadly as the just and heroic swords of his allies. They would not spare a breath in cutting him down, save a short word of condemnation, “coward.” As such, he meets the eye of another Brand, greeted with fury. He has been sentenced to gallows of the most morbid sort - to be stood amid the dreadful, never ending meat grinder. He turns back toward the black wave of wrath and avows to meet his fate. And what he sees shall haunt him until he meets his close end.</p>

<p id="stories">A legion of dark, tall elves approach whilst wreathed in the deafening darkness of their dwelling. Floating above them, an ancient drow wields a terrible wand of reddish black root and chants an incantation. These dark elves wield glinting blades of sharpest steel, cutting down the Herald’s allies and goblins alike. They lack prejudice in their approach - they sprint past both lines and meet no friction as they begin to ravage the Imperial army. The flying practitioner, wielding his wand, finishes an incantation. The sleeve on his left arm is blown about by the wind. De'Leon can briefly see the gangly, bulging veins of the Sin protruding from his left arm. As De'Leon closes his eyes and weeps, he is blown away by the fantastic fire of a Sinner.</p>

<p id="stories">He lies on the ground, trembling and convulsing, waiting impatiently for eternal darkness to finally shade his eyesight. His legs are lame, his breaths shallow. Neither Enemy nor ally comes to end his suffering nor heal him, and so he lays on the battlefield, occasionally trampled by further skirmish. Days pass. He likens himself to a specter, being present enough in this world to witness fights yet never participate. If one were to ask him if he lived, he would question if he had ever lived, or if his existence had always been among the fattened flies that feast on battlefield carrion. He hears brief empire victories and brief Quar victories, each being shortly lived before battles resume. He ponders if the battle will truly stalemate. Eventually, he sees another floating figure wearing flowing white robes of the Empire in the middle of another iteration of the uncountable skirmishes he has witnessed. The Greater Ardent shines upon De'Leon as he fades. As his vision finally darkens, the ground on which he lies is razed by a great and radiant Sun that is wrought by the Ardent.</p>

<p id="stories">The drum continues to beat, never slowing, never waning, even when the heart it once met no longer holds its tempo, for it now holds the hearts of thousands of others to an equal pace. Weeks pass. The battle continues as the Quar continues to reinforce and the empire stands strong. Soldiers charge and retreat, to and fro. The never ending nature of it leaves the souls locked in combat weary and terrified of the next charge organized by the Brands or Drow legionnaires.
