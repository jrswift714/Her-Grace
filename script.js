//I see you. You seek to circumvent the conversation.
//It is out of my power to force you to converse.
//So, I offer you this plea of sorrow from a great and terrible god, who is long dead.

//To thee, Harrow, I speak in shadows:
//Seven fruits of darkness, hidden in their throats,
//When they bloom, the tale is done, already penned.
//I bear the talon of chance,
//A tool guided by forces beyond deathâ€™s grasp,
//Fashioned by more hands than you can count.


//Fear, O Harrow, the reflection of thy soul:
//Four shall rise, born of seven, who were once one,
//Their severance sown by deeds undone.
//Fear not death, for my design weaves beyond,
//Past my reign, past my line, the wheel spins on.

//The hungry,
//The violent,
//The wrathful,
//The wanting,
//The silent,
//The forsaken,
//The great serpent.

//In faithless devotion, none may break these failures,
//Lest by dose of finest chance.
